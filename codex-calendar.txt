Refactor and redesign the Calendar module to be more interactive.

Context:
- Next.js App Router project in this repo.
- Calendar page: src/app/calendar/page.tsx
- Data comes from Convex scheduled_items via api.schedules.listScheduledItems({start,end}) which currently returns items with nextRunAt.
- There is currently a grid view and a list view toggle.

Goals:
1) Refactor Calendar page into smaller components (keep it maintainable):
   - components for header controls, grid view, agenda view, schedule drawer.
2) Redesign UX for small screens:
   - Make Agenda view the default on small screens.
   - Improve spacing/typography and make it feel like a control room.
3) Add week navigation:
   - Prev week / Today / Next week.
   - Week label.
4) Add filters:
   - system filter (openclaw/windows), enabled-only toggle, text search.
5) Improve interactivity:
   - Clicking an item opens a drawer with details.
   - Add "Copy command" and "Copy externalId" buttons.

Stretch (if time):
6) Expand OpenClaw cron schedules into multiple occurrences within the selected week.
   - Parse openclaw scheduleText (it includes cron expr and tz in parentheses) OR store cron expr separately if needed.
   - Use cron-parser to generate all occurrences between start/end.

Constraints:
- Keep i18n support (use useI18n + t() keys; add keys to da/en as needed).
- Ensure npm run lint and npm run build pass.

When done, summarize changes + files modified.
